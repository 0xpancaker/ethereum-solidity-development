### 1. [Learning Solidity Programming](/solidity-development)
Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implement smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This is a code-focused tutorial with detailed explanations and example codes.

- Junior level (Day1 ~ Day3)
- Medium level (Day4 ~ Day6)
- Expert level (Day7 ~ Day9)


### 2. Ethereum knowledge
Solidity is not all of Ethereum. Belows are the helpful ethereum knowledge you should know to become an expert in this industry.

- Day10: [Price Oracle](/ethereum/price-oracle.md)
- Day11: [AMM](/ethereum/AMM.md)
- Day12: [Popular attacks](/ethereum/attacks.md)
- Day13: [DAO]
- Day14: [Governance]


### 3. [Hardhat Starter Project](/hardhat)
This is a very useful hardhat starter project with below packages.

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development.
- [solhint](hardhat-framework-master.zip) for solidity coding.
- [Coverage](https://hardhat.org/plugins/solidity-coverage.html) for check missing logic and untested codes.
- [Waffle.js](https://hardhat.org/guides/waffle-testing.html) for writing unit test.

Not only these packages, it also has useful codes for contract deployment, configuration, some useful libraries or utils for writing unit tests. For smart contract developers, this would be a great starter project.
