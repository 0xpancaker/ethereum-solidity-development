Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implement smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This is a code-focused tutorial with detailed explanations and example codes. I started this repo for my friends who just started solidity development. But if you know some programming laguages like C or JavaScript, you will be able to understand this easily.

### 1. [Learning Solidity Programming](/solidity-development)
You can learn solidity programming by examples
- Junior level (Day1 ~ Day3)
- Medium level (Day4 ~ Day6)
- Expert level (Day7 ~ Day9)

### 2. [Hardhat Starter Project](/hardhat)
These are the useful tools & pacakages for ethereum/smart contract development.
- Use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development.
- Use [solhint](hardhat-framework-master.zip) for solidity coding.
- Use [Coverage](https://hardhat.org/plugins/solidity-coverage.html) for check missing logic and untested codes
- Use [Waffle.js](https://hardhat.org/guides/waffle-testing.html) for writing unit test
  *Using waffle within Hardhat (running waffle tests via a hardhat script) is what's recommended for development by Hardhat/NomicLabs*

### 3. Ethereum/Smart Contract knowledge
- [price-oracle](/defi/price-oracle.md)
- [AMM](/defi/AMM.md)
- [Popular attacks](/defi/attacks.md)
- DAO
- Governance
