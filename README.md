Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implement smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This is a code-focused tutorial with detailed explanations and example codes. I started this repo for my friends who just started solidity development. But if you know some programming laguages like C or JavaScript, you will be able to understand this easily.

#### [1. Learning Solidity Programming](/solidity-development)
You can learn solidity programming by examples
- Junior level (Day1 ~ Day3)
- Medium level (Day4 ~ Day6)
- Expert level (Day7 ~ Day9)

#### 2. Useful Solidity Development Environement and Framework
- Use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for solidity development
You can use Truffle.
But it requires to setup & run test network environemnt using other tool like Ganache.
But Truffle provides its embeded test network called "Hardhat"
- Use [Coverage](https://hardhat.org/plugins/solidity-coverage.html) for check missing logic and untested codes
- Use [Waffle.js](https://hardhat.org/guides/waffle-testing.html) for writing unit test

*Using waffle within Hardhat (running waffle tests via a hardhat script) is what's recommended for development by Hardhat/NomicLabs*


#### 3. Chainlink

#### 4. Governance

#### 5. Famous DeFi Platforms
