Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implement smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This is a code-focused tutorial with detailed explanations and example codes. I started this repo for my friends who just started solidity development. But if you know some programming laguages like C or JavaScript, you will be able to understand this easily.

### 1. [Learning Solidity Programming](/solidity-development)
You can learn solidity programming by examples
- Junior level (Day1 ~ Day3)
- Medium level (Day4 ~ Day6)
- Expert level (Day7 ~ Day9)

### 2. Recommending Development Environement & Framework
- Use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for solidity development
- Use [Coverage](https://hardhat.org/plugins/solidity-coverage.html) for check missing logic and untested codes
- Use [Waffle.js](https://hardhat.org/guides/waffle-testing.html) for writing unit test
  *Using waffle within Hardhat (running waffle tests via a hardhat script) is what's recommended for development by Hardhat/NomicLabs*

### 3. Smart Contract Development
- OpenZeppelin
- Chainlink

### 4. Ethereum development knowledge

1) Defi
Decentralized Finance is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial instruments, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum
